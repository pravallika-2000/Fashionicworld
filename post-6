<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>West Bengal has a rich legacy of amazing literature with great authors like Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay, Rabindranath Tagore, Kazi Nazrul Islam and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay contributing their fair share to the Bengali literature as well as to the world literature. The literature heritage extends well beyond that too. There has been a long tradition of folk tales like the Thakurmar Jhuli, stories of Gopal Bhar and much&nbsp;more which in their popularity bear a great resemblance to famous stories like Arabian nights and the Panchatantra. Bengalis have played a significant role in modernising the course of Indian literature. Rabindranath Tagore even went on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature for his collection of poems - Gitanjali. There were several post modernisation movements in the latter part of the 20th century, some of them were known as Kallol movement, Hungry movement and Little magazines. These movements saw some emerging leaders who would go on to be prominent names in the Bengali literature circle like Sukumar Ray, Jibananda Das, Sunil Gangopadhyay and Syed Mustafa Siraj being a few among them.<br></p>

<h2>Fine Arts</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bengal is credited to be the forerunner of modern contemporary art with famous artists like Abanindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Jamini Roy, Rabindranath Tagore being among the forefront to promote modernization of art in the country. Abanindranath Tagore is sometimes referred to as the 'Father of Modern Indian Art', and he went on to establish the Bengal School of Art to promote artistic styles out of the European influence. Even before the advent of modernisation, there are numerous references to terracotta art and Kalighat paintings which show that art was loved since a long time in the region. After independence, a lot of graffiti with a political propaganda went up on various walls of the state painting witty banters, limericks and of course party promotion. This continues to be popular even now. Due to a ban imposed on painting graffiti on private walls, the paintings are restricted to club walls.</p>

<h2>Traditional Dresses</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bengali women traditionally wear a sari, draping the 'pallu' in a special manner that is exclusive to the state of West Bengal. With modernisation, shalwar kameez have also become famous with the newer generation wearing jeans, dresses and skirts too. The men used to wear dhoti kurtas in olden times but now do so only during some special occasions like during festivals or marriages. Their style is basically fusion with putting on a kurta with jeans apart from the westernised shirt pants. This touch of westernization is especially visible in Kolkata more than in any other city of West Bengal.</p>
