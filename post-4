<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In today's situation I think majority of states look similar because of increased modes of communication, influence of modernisation and westernisation, adopting the best from different parts of world and increasing innovative technologies, life style and moving towards to common jobs I.e away from traditional occupations. So in many scenarios there many be much of intersection of cultures.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So one need to take what is untouched by all these factors I.e either rural side of the state or something before 3-4 decades compared to today. Even then I feel it is impossible to avoid neighborhood states like Karnataka and Maharashtra and our own Telugu speaking state Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apart from this, if it is about individual, then things will be much more complex, so it's better to go by on an average how society follows. I'm not sure evey aspect will be exactly different from other states but I will try to mention what I know.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Culture</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Culture is a broad term and it involves many things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Festivals</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As many know, Telangana has two special festivals and are in fact declared as state festivals.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bathukamma</strong>&nbsp;- Celebrated during Devi Navratri</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9763ab7a53d3f143fcb28cf894a62cba-lq" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Boddemma</strong>&nbsp;- celebrated before Bathukamma, usually by young unmarried girls.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-854e54755904a11e43a08af25f9767e2-lq" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Traditionally, since Bathukamma &amp; Boddemma is related to Goddess Gauri and is usually women oriented. Dusshera is unofficially reserved for men in Telangana and it is a Non Veg festival, as traditionally there is a concept of Bali on this day and in significance to Vijaya Dashami, Jammi(Shami) Plant is worshipped in every village and leaves are exchanged with all near and dear at evenings by taking blessings of elders and saying “Happy Dussehra”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Bathukamma, Boddemma and Dusshera are all considered part of Dusshera Celebrations which almost extends to 20 days so is the reason for it being referred as Pedda Panduga (Biggest Festival) in Telangana.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(Note : Shami Puja is also there in neighbouring states but it is celebrated here with extra sound)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bonalu</strong>&nbsp;- The other major festival which is meant to be a offering of food to Village deities or Lord Shiva is Bonalu. It is majorly celebrated during Ashada Month especially in Hyderabad but not exactly restricted to that month, as it varies according to customs of family or village too!!

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sankranti</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The special ritual here is food!! The special food “Sakinalu” prepared for Sankranti are prepared with dedication and devotion to Goddess Gowri. The importance of this snack item doesn't just confine to this festival but also extends to Marriages, Puberty functions etc implies it has a special place in Telangana society and may also be called as “Sacred Snacks” of Telangana.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Vinayaka Chavithi</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ganesh Chathurthi is celebrated grandly in Telangana. There is a special traditional custom which can be observed in considerable number of houses to this day, where Lord Ganesha's foot setps are drawn with Lime(Choona/Sunnam) and Jaaji(Red stone) in the pattern of concentric circles infront of houses as rangoli and also on doors. These patterns symbolise arrival of Lord Vinayaka to one's house who drew them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though exact pictures are not available, they look similar to these patterns.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sri Rama Navami</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The culture of Sita-Rama Kalyanam (Eternal Marriage) especially the Muthyala(Pearls) Talambralu ritual made popular by Bhakta Ramadasu from the Temple town of Badrachalam spread to whole Telugu lands in both the Telugu states.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-72d252526f500f05771e5613b90aa078-lq" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Peerla Panduga (Muharrum</strong>)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Though Battle of Karbala is not directly related to Telangana society but with the influence of Qutb Shahis who were Shias, Hindus started celebrating it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hindus don't actually mourn like Shias but they feel them as deities with mystic powers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-70e957bf668f2740a278cde95712d13b-lq" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Marriages</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of the special rituals in Telangana Marriages are Ireni Kundalu, Kuradu etc where pots are used. The designs on those pots look like age old customs which can also be seen from IVC pots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d8e867e8f3d26ce28b6fa1f93a51eaf3-lq" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Telangana Marriages also serve Non-Veg which is probably a cultural shock to many other states including Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Native religious culture</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mallana</strong>&nbsp;(Mallikarjuna Swamy) who is believed to be Lord Shiva himself and is called as Mailara deva in Karnataka and Khandoba in Maharashtra. Though the story behind his avatar is almost same, there are many unique rituals like Patnalu (Eternal Marriage), where ritualistic rangolis and patterns are made. Traditional Ritualistic music like Oggu Dolu is performed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f667e2ca4d5a5f729d368f409d968e70-lq" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Sammakka Jathara</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Initially celebrated specifically by Tribals of Telangana, the deities are once warriors who rebelled against Kakatiya dynasty is now spread almost majority of mainstream Hindu Society. This has also earned the name of Tribal Kumbhmela of India and is the largest Tribal gathering festival of India.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Mainstream Religious culture</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Among Mainstream deities Lord Narsimha, Lord Rama, Lord Anjaneya, Lord Shiva used to have most appeal in Telangana. One can find many old Lord Narasimha temples in their locality but this also apply to Andhra Pradesh and in today's context almost all the deities are revered with equal importance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-02654f856124ad473532e48dbf9510da-lq" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is a special custom called&nbsp;<strong>Kode Mokku</strong>&nbsp;in few shaivaite temples especially in Vemulawada, which is considered as important temple.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d95c39f2343614c9d0ca6c0d659bb140-lq" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other special custom is Vadi(Odi) Biyyam for hindu female deities, where women offer sacred rice to goddess, just like the custom of mother does same custom for her daughter in Telugu regions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6ba1677a0ec868859ea9573da5d0166a-lq" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Architecture</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With different rulers ruling ar different times one can see almost all architectures of India here ranging from Nagara, Vesara, Deccani to Dravida. But the prominent among them is Kakatiyan Vesara Style, under whom the the tradition of Thonranas that had continued from the ages of Sanchi Stupa has reached it's zenith. Infact the thorana is official emblem of state.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b01be88bdc141472371410624fd1409d-lq" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But currently no much preference is given to this architectural heritage and every thing is being interfered to change in to Dravida style.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Arts</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Telangana is also famous for its handlooms and there are artists who could weave a saree that could fit in a match box.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1b31e0eea6260b8de437e02aebddcd7e-lq" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Classical Music</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Perini Shivathandavam,&nbsp;</strong>which dates back to Kakatiya dynasty<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is recognised as Dance form of Telangana.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Lifestyle</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Food</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Food in Telangana is&nbsp;<strong>spicy</strong>&nbsp;compared to majority of the states and food items range from Sarva Pindi, Gudalu to Hyderabadi Biriyani, Haleem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0073301099a8ddeb49cbb3265c667f4a-lq" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I mentioned Telangana marriages serve Non-Vegetarian food and apart from that serving “Bagara” rice is classical way of celebrating weddings here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-24c57866b8b8cda672a0e830b61be590-lq" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many traditional sweets ranging from Seera, Bakshalu, Sattu Pindi to Hyderabad based special sweets like Qubani Ka Meeta, Kaddu ki Kheer. Among which I feel Double Ka meeta stands special.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4ed4f49df9d8164f5efd721a74a33d24-lq" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being on Deccan plateau Telangana's food was traditionally dominated by Corn, Jowar, Ragi etc though the dietary pattern shifted to Rice based items today. Makka Garelu is a noteworthy snack item in the lifestyle of Telangana individual.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since Telangana face extreme summers, Traditionally Sharbat(Lemon Juice) and Ragi Java was common among households of the state but at present cool drinks and varieties of fruit juice dominated them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Attire</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hyderabad is known as not just&nbsp;<strong>City of Pearls, City of Rocks, City of Clocks, City of Gardens, City of Palaces&nbsp;</strong>but is also a&nbsp;<strong>City of Bangles!</strong>! Women in Telangana traditionally wear wrist full of bangles though not a mandatory in current scenario. Laad Bazar in Hyderabad is a hub of popular Bangles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7d49b396861735223b6c636eb4b505de-lq" alt=""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Traditionally women's attire was Gochi Kattu and Men's attire was Dhothi, Angi and Tala Paga(Headgear). At present very few/rarely someone follow this exact custom. Both the traditional attires are not much different from neighbouring states.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Politics</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>History always turns it's way in to the form of politics, Telangana got it's independence on Sept 17 1948 and politics have the touch of criticizing past feudalism. We often listen to “Politics of Gadis” which means rule from Forted houses. One can find such structures for every 4–5 villages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apart from that being a centre of many past kingdoms, state too has many forts like atleast one in every 1–2 Talukas</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Language</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Telugu is language of the land and apart from that Telangana is also a place where a new language took it's identity I.e “<strong>Dakhani</strong>” much before Urdu got it's identity in Indian Sub Continent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
