<p>What is life like in Europe? The question is exceedingly complex. Life in Europe, like anywhere, varies a lot. Life in European cities is different from the country. Life in the UK and Scandinavia is different from continental Europe. Life in Western Europe is different from Eastern Europe. To summarize an entire way of life in a whole continent, much less one that contains around 50 countries, is no easy task.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But there are still certain patterns we can discuss, certain generalizations in various parts of Europe that seem to apply. Today we're going to go location by location and discuss how life varies in different parts of Europe.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Western Europe</strong>&nbsp;is the part of Europe that generally includes the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Luxembourg. Sometimes Scandinavia is included due to cultural similarities, sometimes not. This part of Europe is by far the richest and contains major financial centers like London and Paris. The cities of Western Europe, especially in the UK, France, and Germany, are responsible for a large proportion of the economic growth, and life there is different from much of the rest of Europe. Like in many places, city life is faster-paced and more stressful. People drive faster, talk to the neighbors less, and work longer hours.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But you don't have to go far from a major city, even in Western Europe, to find this attitude change. In most of Europe, including the countryside of France, Germany, and Spain, life is relatively laid-back and slow-paced, people work less demanding schedules, and family and mealtimes are central parts of life. Europe has strong social safety nets and this further reduces the level of stress in people's lives. Few people have cause to worry about finding themselves living on the street or having crippling medical bills.</p>

<p>Religion plays a less-significant role in everyday life than places like the United States, and the majority do not attend church regularly. This is especially true in Western Europe, which is more secular than other parts of Europe. Crime is also relatively low, even in cities. Europe is very much a safe place to live.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Heading south, you find hotter weather along the Mediterranean coast.&nbsp;<strong>Mediterranean Europe</strong>&nbsp;is an area that includes Eastern Spain, Southern France, Italy, Croatia, Greece, Montenegro, and Albania. Life in this part of Europe is even more laid-back and relaxed than further north. Relatively large amounts of time are spent with family, and mealtimes are extremely important to many cultures in this area, especially French, Italian, and Greek cultures. People will routinely spend several hours eating a meal with family. People are also much more religious here, especially in Italy where the Catholic faith is dominant.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Little typifies this approach to life more than the <strong>siesta</strong>, which is a short nap in the early afternoon, usually after lunch. This is especially common in Spain, Southern Italy, and Greece. Businesses tend to close for anything from an hour to four or five hours, and reopen in the evening. In parts of Europe where siestas aren't common (such as Western and Northern Europe), businesses tend to close earlier in the evenings.</p>

<h2>Time Zones&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Europe has only <strong>three time zones</strong>:  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Western European Time or GMT: Iceland, Ireland, Portugal and the United Kingdom;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Central European Time or CET (GMT+1): (the majority of the European Union Member States and other countries between Spain in the west to Poland in the east);&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Eastern European Time or EET (GMT+2): Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Romania and Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Beyond continental Europe and its nearby islands, there are some far outposts of European countries with different time zones, such as the Azores (Portugal), which follows Greenwich Mean Time and French overseas territories such as Guadeloupe, which is in the GMT-4 time zone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given that the maximum number of hours ahead or behind you can experience in Europe is two, time zones mostly affect your trip in the context of travel. The best approach? Check ahead of time to see if you’ll be crossing any time zones, and if so, simply keep that in mind when it comes to logistics or scheduling.&nbsp;And remember that most European countries use the&nbsp;24-hour clock,&nbsp;especially for train and plane schedules.</p>
